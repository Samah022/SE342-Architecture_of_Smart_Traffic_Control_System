(STCS). It includes details about the main system requirements, both functional and
non-functional, as well as a thorough discussion of the system analysis and design. This
analysis covers system components and system architecture.

Additionally, the report includes an analysis and discussion chapter that covers the design
principles used, architectural patterns chosen, and decisions made to ensure quality attributes
were met. This section also covers the middleware and framework used and concludes with
an evaluation of the software architecture, providing justifications for design choices
